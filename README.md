# Starling Murmuration Simulation
Starlings are a fascinating kind of birds which have evolved to fly in a mindblowingly complex and beautiful pattern called murmurations.

(Find a YouTube video of real Starlings flying [here](https://youtu.be/V4f_1_r80RY))  

- In this project, I have tried to simlulate a Starling murmuration in Python using a mutually attractive and velocity-equalising force acting on each bird by some n number of adjacent birds.  
- Numpy is used to speedup the 3D operations involved and OpenCV is used to create the videos.

Since the output videos are too large in size to be uploaded on GitHub, I have stored them in Google Drive linked below.
