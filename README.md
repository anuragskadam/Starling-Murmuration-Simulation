# Starling Murmuration Simulation
Starlings are a fascinating kinds of birds which have evolved to fly in a mindblowingly complex and beautiful pattern called murmurations. You can check out how this looks in the National Geographtic video linked below.

In this project, I have tried to simlulate a Starling murmuration in Python using mutually attractive and force-equalising force acting on each bird by some 'NO_ADJ_BIRDS' number of birds.

Numpy is used to speedup the 3D operations involved and OpenCV is used to create the videos.

Since the output videos are too large in size to be uploaded on GitHub, I have stored them in Google Drive linked below.
